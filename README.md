## Usage

### ES Modules in Node

We use ECMAScript Modules in the backend in this project. Be sure to have at least Node v14.6+ or you will need to add the "--experimental-modules" flag.

Also, when importing a file (not a package), be sure to add .js at the end or you will get a "module not found" error

You can also install and setup Babel if you would like

### Env Variables

Create a .env file in then root and add the following

```
NODE_ENV = development
PORT = 5000
MONGO_URI = your mongodb uri
JWT_SECRET = your own string
PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID = your paypal client id
```

### Install Dependencies (frontend & backend)

```
npm install
cd frontend
npm install
```

### Run

```
# Run frontend (:3000) & backend (:5000)
npm run dev

# Run backend only
npm run server
```

## Build & Deploy

```
# Create frontend prod build
cd frontend
npm run build
```

There is a Heroku postbuild script, so if you push to Heroku, no need to build manually for deployment to Heroku

## Description

Still Good is a product tracking tool, designed to remedy your wasteful habits or curate your existing flow of perishable items. The idea is to support budget-conscious or waste-conscious people in their missions to move products from store to consumed by the expiration dates.

**Project Requirements:**

- Use React for the front end.

- Use GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js server.

- Use MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM for the database.

- Use queries and mutations for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data.

- Be deployed using Heroku (with data).

- Have a polished UI.

- Be responsive.

- Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

- Include authentication (JWT).

- Protect sensitive API key information on the server.

- Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class and id naming conventions, indentation, high-quality comments, etc.).

- Have a high-quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
